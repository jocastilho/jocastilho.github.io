<p>2011</p>
<p>Briefing: The client requested a new image concept to their service. All the rebranding was about a simple and modern logo, that represented movement, passion and the village, Cascais. This is a village mainly known by its monuments and good fish and fishermens life. 
The logo represents that passion with heart shaped arrows, layered on top of each other, making a sort of fish scales pattern.
Based on the the old shape of the brand (a rounded arrow), I decided to keep the arrow, giving it a different color and movement. </p>
