<p>Briefing: To design and implement a white-label video on-demand platform for web and mobile devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An on­going programme within Arqiva has been to deliver linear and on­-demand video content to a wide ­range of connected devices whilst integrating digital­ rights management, advertising and analytics. Extending the iPlayer technology used by the BBC the team as been able to deliver video content on to a wide­range of devices.</p>
<p>Main page with hero content, would display the current program from the selected channel, the header was branded depending on clients requirements. Up to 4 channels could be displayed with content sorted by 'Now' - current content to be highlighted with brands main colour - 'Next' and 'Later'. An overlay panel with relevant information would be displayed with a different colour, it could be an error, warning or just a dialogue text with action butons.</p>
